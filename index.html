              Researched the most efficient design and implementation of
              algorithms. We spent the semester writing Java and C++ code with
              Visual Studio Code. With the help of our professor, we created
              various sorting and searching algorithms, and analyzed how these
              algorithms could be utilized to solve graphical and mathematical
              problems.

              Managed a $260,000 portfolio with eight other students. We created
              Discounted Cash Flow models of the companies we were interested in
              adding to the portfolio. Based on the intrinsic value found from
              our DCF model's and sensitivity analyses of the stock, we would
              determine whether the stocks were worth pursuing.

              maintaining a secure network. We also researched the inner
              workings of encryption and authentication using public or private
              keys and digital certificates. Our research was conducted on
              virtualized operating systems using Oracle Virtual Box.

              For the start of my senior year, I had the opportunity to run a
              semester long research project. Looking to improve my Cyber
              Security knowledge and skills, I decided to run a virtualized
              honeypot throughout the semester. Honeypots are inherently
              insecure servers, designed to be attacked so that system
              administrators can analyze the results. Based on the data
              collected from their honeypots, security researchers can then
              adjust their networks accordingly to prevent future attacks on
              their main network. My research full and analysis can be found
